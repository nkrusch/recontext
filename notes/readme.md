# Questions

1. [How does DIG work?](dig.md)

2. What is the impact on the inference if we...
   * Increase the degree, i.e., number of variables
   * Adding more/giving fewer traces, i.e., change the number of rows
   * Restrict value domain (Z, nat, binary)

3. What are some other ways to infer invariants from numerical data
   * This is a lit review question (may have nothing to do with FM or PL)
   * Ultimately we want to do some comparison

# Notes

### Some baseline assumptions about inputs

* We are interested in numerical invariants
* A variable holds one value at a time
* Integer domain (or a subset)
* relationships between variables (vs. individual variables)
* null values -- unknown

I use "trace" as a generic term for numerical tabular data.
A trace could be generated from a program execution (but it could also come from other sources).

### Intuitions

* I suspect an inference technique will fail "easily" if we only provide traces as input
  - We may be unable to say much about the input => what can we say?
  - Why/what makes the inference fail?
  
* Increasing the difficulty of inference (e.g., higher variable count, more
  traces, or "noisy" trace) will likely break inference.
* Can we uncover/describe the limitations/boundary of the state-of-the-art
  techniques?

# Invariant inference techniques

* Daikon [@ernst2007] observes concrete program states that capture the values
  of variables at designated locations in the program when a program is run on a
  given input. By sampling large numbers of inputs, Daikon can determine
  relationships that may hold among variables across those samples. Confirming
  that those relationships constitute a true invariant has been a focus of
  follow-on work to Daikon.

Some (PL) strategies

- static techniques: (these are sound) abstract interpretation and the constraint-based approach are the most widespread approaches [@furia2010]
- dynamic (unsound, incomplete): template-based invariant inference [@alur2013, @colon2003, @jeannet2014, @sankaranarayanan2004, @srivastava2009, @ernst2007, @srivastava2012]
- hybrid approach: dynamically infers candidate invariants, then attempt to verify they hold for all inputs [@zhang2014, @padhi2016, @garg2016, @nguyen2017, @yao2020]
