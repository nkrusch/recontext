# Questions

1. [How does DIG work](dig.md)

2. What is the impact on the inference if we...
    * increase the degree, i.e., number of variables
    * add more/give less traces, i.e., change number of rows
    * restrict value domain (Z, nat, binary)
   
3. What are some other ways to infer invariants from numerical data
    * This is a lit review question (may have nothing to do with FM or PL)
    * Ultimately we want to do some comparison
